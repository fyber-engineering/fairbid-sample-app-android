Fyber's FairBid - Sample Android application
============================================
This sample app demonstrates the FairBid SDK integration best practices. It is aligned with the FairBid developer documentation - developer.fyber.com, which we recommend you to read as well.

Please note that when it comes to actually demonstrating the product "FairBid" as a monetization platform this sample app might fail due to the fact that ad delivery depends on factors like your country, your device your AAID/IDFA or any other kind of information that ad networks might have collected about you and that are taken into consideration when placing a bid to show an ad to you.
